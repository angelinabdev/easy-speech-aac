## Purpose

This project was born from a personal need. As a caregiver to a nonverbal, autistic sibling, I experienced firsthand the barriers families face in finding affordable, intuitive, and flexible AAC tools. Easy Speech AAC reflects the belief that technology should meet users where they are — and help them grow beyond.
